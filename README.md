This repo is the project2 by `Zhen Xu 520370910043` for the vg101 course.

This README file gives the explanations of the codes.

# Usage

## 1 gcc

Use the following command to run the code and input values as prompted.

In milestone 1 you just need to enter an integer.(desk numbers)

gcc *.c -o a -O2 -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -std=c11

a.exe

## 2 clion

I have a CMakeLists.txt.

you can use it.

## 1 How function works

I will finish this part later.

Because I can not figure out a clear way to describe my struct in persudo code.

I just talk very easily.

I will explain them clearly later.

### 1.1 draw_card and give_card

A) First copy the last card in the stock pile and give it to a certain player.

B) Delete the last card in the stock.

### 1.2 initialize functions (_all_players, _index_to _card, _pile)

They all give some initial value.

### 1.3 main function

Almost all the code in main is used to test whether the function can work or not.

They will be updated.

### 1.4 header.h

Declare functions and struct
